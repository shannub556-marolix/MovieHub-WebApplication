Task: Create a responsive web application that displays a list of movies and allows users to search and filter movies by title, genre, and release year. The application should have a visually appealing design and provide a smooth user experience.


->firstly will create a html page and inclue header , main and footer , which are kept empty and dedault 
->then will get into Themoviedb site and get our Api to access miovies data
-> After getting our Api, will get started with Javascript and get all data to display
-> By using onlick events and event listeners ,if any filters are applied or event is clciked will perform operations according to that event
-> then will move into css and Apply some filters so that, movie should be displayed side to side and apply some style to footer sections


HTML 
    in Html page, by default we will keep three sections 
        one is for Header section to display - our page heading and there only we will keep filter options to search , filter by movie name or filter by filter by year
        and Main section is to display movie details which we get from Api, intially we will display all movie details 
        Finally, Footer section which we display some essentail details which we need

Javascript
    In Javascript, first we will get all the fileds and store it in one constant variable
    and then from there , intially we will get all movies data with the help of fetch method through Api key by passing Access token and store it in one variable called MoviesData
    After getting Data, will reflect back that data to options to display data in options(dropdown) and display all MoviesData intially 
    from there after if any changes or onlick events were detected like filtering or giving input , then addEvent_Handler will be triggered and FilterMovies method will be called and details will be displayed according to the filter 
    Incase , if we don't have the movie or movies details doesn't exsist then we will retun message "No Movies Found"
    Even  if click on name of movie title , then onclick addEvent_Handler will be triggered and it will redirected to new webpage displaying movie details 

css
    from there we will be moving to css and applying some styles 
    fixing the page boundaries , so that it will be quite accessable in even mobile , tab and desktop 
    and applying some colours to footer and header 


Features :
    Responsive we page which gives responses in a single
    dynamic we page , which changes according to input 
    A Responsive Page whcih filters movies according to the input
    Search Movies details by Movie_title
    cross-browser compatibility all over devices
    
Api_Integration :
    With the help of Themoviedb we will create an API along with that we will be having Access token
    In Javascript we will Authenticate with the help of Access Token and get Movies Data with the help of Api key
    with that part of Api_Integration we can access data seamlessly
